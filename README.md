## Description:

- In this assignment, we create an application that uses Node and Express server. It is also backed up by MySQL database. We also follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in our application, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
- To create our page, we use HTML and Materialize CSS.
- We also use a third-party API: 

## Create a MVC file structure: 

- 1: Config (connection.js and orm.js)
- 2: Controllers (burger_controller.js)
- 3: db (schema.sql and seeds.sql)
- 4: models (burgers.js)
- 5: node_modules
- 6: Package.json
- 7: public [assets(css and img)]
- 8: server.js
- 9: views (handlerbars)

Once the files are set up, we need to create the connection among them.
